# Task Reward System

## Overview
This Python program allows users to create a list of tasks, mark them as complete, and track their progress. It provides encouraging messages based on completion levels.

## Features
- Add a list of tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- View progress percentage
- Receive motivational messages based on performance

## Requirements
- Python 3 or later installed on your system

## How to Run
1. **Download or Copy the Script**
   - Save the Python script as `task_reward_system.py` OR create a folder to store it in (in this case, you do not need to change the name of the file)

2. **Run the Script**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt. (Recommend using the Python interface directly, or downloading Visual Studio Code and running it inside there.)
   - Navigate to the folder where the script is saved using `cd`.
   - Run the script with:
     ```sh
     python task_reward_system.py
     ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**
   - Enter your name.
   - Provide a list of tasks (comma-separated).
   - Mark tasks as complete by typing their names.
   - Type `exit` to quit the program.

## Example Usage
```
Enter your name: Alice
Enter tasks separated by commas: Laundry, Homework, Exercise

Alice's Task Progress:
[✘] Laundry
[✘] Homework
[✘] Exercise
Completion: 0.00%
Let's get started! You can do this!

Enter a task to mark as complete (or type 'exit' to quit): Homework
```

## Notes
- Ensure Python is installed before running the script.
- Use `python3` instead of `python` on macOS/Linux if needed.
- The program does not save progress after exiting.

Since this is made for a school project, it is open-source and availiable for public use.
